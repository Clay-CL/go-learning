# Learning Go

Why learn go?
- aim of go was to make writing efficient software easy
- unlike rust, it compiles fast but doesn't run as fast as it
- it also has a garbage collector, making rust better to use for system level programs (linux kernel, etc)
- Go is prefered to make CLIs, servers, even docker is written in Go
